### Hi there!
I am **Maxim Menshikov**, and this is the account for my security research activity which I was doing since 2007. Static analysis research activities can be seen at [@maximmenshikov](https://github.com/maximmenshikov).

During my security research I was concentrated on:
 - Windows Phone 7
 - Windows Phone 8
 - Windows Mobile 6.x
 - Sony Ericsson feature phones

Here you can find my projects in these fields.
