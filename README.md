### Hi there!
I am **Maxim Menshikov**, and this is the account for my security research activity which I was doing since 2007. Static analysis research activities can be seen at [@maximmenshikov](https://github.com/maximmenshikov).

*EDIT: I am currently moving most repositories to [@maximmenshikov](https://github.com/maximmenshikov). Check all projects in [@dynamicsrom](https://github.com/dynamicsrom) and [@dynamics7](https://github.com/dynamics7) organizations.*

During my security research I was concentrated on:
 - Windows Phone 7
 - Windows Phone 8
 - Windows Mobile 6.x
 - Sony Ericsson feature phones
